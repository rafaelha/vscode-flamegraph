# Flamegraphs in VS Code - Visualizing Profiles from the py-spy profiler

Profiling your code with Flamegraph is easy:

1. Open a Python file in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the command palette
3. Select the command `Flamegraph: Profile active file with py-spy`

That's it!

Your code will be profiled using [py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy). You can interrupt the profiling anytime via `Ctrl+C`
or wait for it to finish.
Then, the profiling results are visualized as line annotations in the editor and shown as a flamegraph in a new tab.

> **Note:** On macOS, `py-spy` requires root privileges. To avoid entering your password repeatedly, you can add `py-spy` to the sudoers file by running:
> ```bash
> sudo visudo -f /private/etc/sudoers.d/myOverrides
> ```
>
> Then, add the following line to the file:
> ```
> username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/py-spy
> ```
> Replace `username` with your actual username and `/path/to/py-spy` with the path to the `py-spy` executable (you can find it by running `which py-spy` in your terminal).

## Usage

The extension visualizes profiling data in two ways:

1. **Inline Code Annotations**: Shows timing information for each function scope, with colors indicating the scope level.

2. **Interactive Flamegraph**: Displays the complete call stack of your profiled code (see [this article](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) about flamegraphs). You can:
   - Click any element to zoom in
   - Click parent elements to zoom out
   - `Cmd+Click` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Click` (Windows/Linux) any element to jump directly to that code.

The inline annotations and flamegraph are linked:
When you zoom in the flamegraph, the inline annotations automatically filter to show only the timing data for the visible part of the flamegraph.

The flamegraph and inline annotations complement each other: The flamegraph shows call-stack specific data, while inline annotations show aggregated function-level profile data.

## Commands

-   `Flamegraph: Profile active file with py-spy` - Profile the active file with py-spy and display the results inline.

-   `Flamegraph: Load Profile` - Load a profile from a file. Currently only py-spy profiles are supported.

-   `Flamegraph: Toggle Inline Profile` - Show or hide the inline profile bars.

-   `Flamegraph: Show` - Open a new tab showing the flamegraph.

-   `Flamegraph: Attach py-spy to running process` - Attach py-spy to a running process and display the results inline. The extension will ask for a Process ID (PID) to attach to.

-   `Flamegraph: Attach py-spy to running process (native)` - Also collects profiling data from native (e.g. C++) extensions. This is not supported on all platforms. See this [blog post by Ben Frederickson](https://www.benfrederickson.com/profiling-native-python-extensions-with-py-spy/).

## Contributing

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies for both the extension and webview UI source code
npm run install:all

# Build webview UI source code
npm run build:webview
```

Then, in VS Code

1. Press `F5` to open a new Extension Development Host window
2. Inside the host window, open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and type `Flamegraph: Profile active file with py-spy`


### TODO

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Option to filter the flamegraph by module. Since processes are treated as a module, this would, e.g., allow to show the flamegraph resolved for all processes or combined for all processes.
- [ ] Refactor flamegraph. Currently, the whole graph is recomputed on every mouse hover event.
- [ ] Search in flamegraph
- [ ] Profiling files without opening a workspace/folder. Currently, the extension requires a workspace/folder to be opened.
- [ ] Memray memory profiles
- [ ] Zoom animations in flamegraph
